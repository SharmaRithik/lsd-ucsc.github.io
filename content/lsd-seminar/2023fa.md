The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For fall 2023, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar in a hybrid fashion.  Anyone can attend on Zoom, and local folks can gather in person in the lab.  Speakers can join either in person or on Zoom, whichever is convenient.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Speaker:**  Vikram Narayanan

**Title:** Towards fine-grained compartmentalization of operating system kernels

**Abstract:** Commodity operating systems execute core kernel subsystems in a single
address space along with hundreds of dynamically loaded extensions and
device drivers. Lack of isolation within the kernel implies that a
vulnerability in any of the kernel subsystems or device drivers opens
a way to mount a successful attack on the entire kernel. Historically,
isolation within the kernel remained prohibitive due to the high cost
of hardware isolation primitives. Recent CPUs, however, bring a new
set of mechanisms. Extended page-table (EPT) switching with VM
functions and memory protection keys (MPKs) provide memory isolation
and invocations across boundaries of protection domains with overheads
comparable to system calls.

I will talk about how we developed a collection of techniques for
lightweight isolation of privileged kernel code(LXDs and LVDs) that
demonstrates near-native performance of two (network, block)
high-performance device drivers. I will present KSplit, a framework
for isolating unmodified device drivers in a modern, full featured
kernel that performs automated analyses on the unmodified source code
of the kernel and the driver to identify shared state and
synchronization requirements for efficient isolation.

**Bio:** Vikram recently graduated with a PhD from the University of
Utah. His research interests are building secure operating system
kernels, and heterogeneous systems.

**Title:** Compositional & Scalable Programming in Granite

**Abstract:** Granite is a strict and untyped programming language under development with the
goal of enhancing functional programming along a number of axes.
It aims to provide a basis for general-purpose programming that is:

1. Compositional: It is easy to extend (mutually) recursive functions to
    support new cases.
2. Expressive: Programmers can work with both the rich data structures common
    in functional programming as well as cyclic data more naturally supported by
    Datalog.
3. Scalable: Programs naturally incorporate parallelism in a manner reminiscent
    of LVars. This should also extend to eventually consistent-by-design distributed
    computation a la CRDTs.

Perhaps surprisingly, these three aspects of language design are related:
Granite's design is emerging from the observation that the key to achieving each
of the above-mentioned goals is a join-semilattice. Granite makes semilattice
structure a first-class language feature; we'll see what this means by example.

**Bio:** Nick is a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. He applies mathematical
concepts from abstract algebra to make it more practical for programmers to
break their code into smaller reusable components while also scaling their
programs across a distributed system.

**Title:** Advancing Property-Based Testing in Theory and Practice

**Abstract:** Property-based testing (PBT) is a testing methodology that allows users to write executable
specifications of programs and test those specifications with automatically generated program
inputs. PBT is well-documented as a power-tool for bug-finding, with success stories at companies
like DropBox, Volvo, and Amazon, but we think it has still not reached its full potential. Our group
has taken a user-centered approach to advancing PBT, talking to real developers and discovering the
challenges that they face when using it.

I present two new abstractions for random data generators---free generators and reflective
generators---that help address some of these challenges. Free generators re-imagine generators as
"parsers of randomness." They show that a generator is really a parser for sequences of random
choices, and this perspective suggests new generation techniques. Reflective generators build on
free generators, adding support for "backward" execution in which a generated value can be turned
back into the sequence of choices that produced it. Backward generator execution is the foundation
for a wealth of new algorithms, including ones for test-case "shrinking," test-case mutation, and
example-based generator tuning.

Moving forward, we plan to focus on usability: free and reflective generators should be easy for
developers to write, and they should make other parts of the PBT process easier as well. I discuss
future work in this direction.

**Bio:** Harry Goldstein is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by professor
Benjamin Pierce. His work leverages techniques from both programming languages and human-computer
interaction to make tools for software testing more powerful and usable. You can find his

**Title:** VyZX: Formal Verification of a Graphical Language

**Abstract:** Mathematical representations of graphs often resemble adjacency matrices or lists, representations that facilitate whiteboard reasoning and algorithm design. In the realm of proof assistants, inductive representations effectively define semantics for formal reasoning. This highlights a gap where algorithm design and proof assistants require a fundamentally different structure of graphs. To address this gap, we present VyZX, a verified library for reasoning about inductively defined graphical languages. These inductive constructs arise naturally from category theory definitions. A key goal for VyZX is to verify the ZX calculus, a graphical language for reasoning about categorical quantum mechanics. Used as a more general model than the standard quantum circuit model, the ZX calculus equips its construction “ZX-diagrams” with a collection of diagrammatic rewrite rules that preserve the graph's semantic interpretation. The ZX calculus has been shown to be useful for building quantum error correction, quantum compilers, and for general graphical reasoning. In VyZX using an initial set of rules proven through their semantics, we proceed to prove facts about the ZX calculus by only appealing to statements about the ZX calculus using standard proof assistant techniques. VyZX integrates easily with the proof engineer's workflow through visualization, automation and verified conversion of quantum circuits to ZX diagrams. 

**Bio:** Adrian Lehmann is a PhD student at the University of Chicago adivsed by John Reppy working with Robert Rand. His interests lie in programming languages: compilation, verification, and using PL for better software engineering. He’s currently exploring applying these techniques to quantum computing.
